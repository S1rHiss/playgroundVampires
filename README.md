Chained Vampires are 7000 algorithmically generated NFTs, chained on Avalanche network. They have one purpose: hunting AVAX for their owners. How?
1) 20% Minting Fee Reflections to all Vampire owners!

If you are among early minters, not only you will amortize minting fee but also your vampire will continue sucking AVAX for you from each minting as long as you hold it.
2) 5% life time royalty to original minter

Vampires care alot about their minter. Each time a vampire is sold, its original minter will get 5% from each sale. Forever.
3) 4% marketplace revenue distribution for all vampire owners

Marketplace will open when minting process is complete. From each second hand sale, all holders will get %4 of the revenue.

Rewards are instantly available to be claimed and given directly as AVAX. So you don’t have to deal with some kind of weird custom token.

There are 6 different vampire races in total. Each race has certain rarity. All vampires benefit from same Tokenomics. Still, some races have extremely rare attributes and DNA! Rarities for each race is as follows:

Each vampire is unique. Some attributes are only available to certain races. Total of 400 different attributes are available for both male and female vampires.

    Countless million possibilities…

Each vampire has born with an unique DNA, unalterable in anyway. This means thatyour vampire may turn humans (or apes) into rarest vampires in near future. This also means that your vampire may win thoughest encounters in the cold metaverse. Rarest vampires also have rarest DNAs

Bite & turn mechanics will be available when minting process is finished. Early minters will benefit from Caged Slave Human Airdrop as well as Blood Bank airdrop which are going to be key factor for creating new generation vampires.

Vampires offer many things for their minters and holders. But one may choose to sell. In that case, extremely rare attributes may be a parameter of the sale price.

There is a chance of <1% for minting a Draxo vampire. Once human, then turned by Dracula himself, a Draxo vampire has 100% chance of creating a Elder+ tier vampire.
