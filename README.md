    Dracula is the rarest piece of whole universe and there is only 1 available. Player who acquires Dracula will have special previlages which no other player has.

    Draxo is very unique dark-vampire race. Draxos are the vampires who are converted by Dracula himself. Their creation, attributes and apperance are totally different from other races. Players who acquires one of the Draxos will also have some advantageus previlages.

    Elder vampires wear a velvet cloak. Their age and origin is unknown. Altough, it is certain that they were always here, staying in the shadows. They witnessed all the chaos and corruption that humankind caused. They remained neutral and never chose a side. Their only priority is to remain undisturbed and to feed with the finest quality blood. One last thing, their power is unkown since no brave warrior was able to return from his attempt to kill an Elder.

    Nosferatus are the terrifying night creatures. They enjoy causing pain and playing with their victims. They have no sense of fear except Dracula. They can't be controlled, they won't accept any agreements or rules. They can appear in any human shape and form but usually their apperance is very disturbing. Their priority is not feeding or blood, but it is chaos and pain.

    Predator vampires are natural hunters. They drink any kind of human blood. As a hunting strategy, predator vampires are integrated themselves into human society and they are very skilled to hide their vampire identitiy. So their apperance is shaped accordingly. Still, their apperance may be very unique and remarkable. Their strength is unmached with a human. Occassionaly they fight among themselves for claiming power on certain territories.

    Scavangers are filthy creatures which can feed on anything including carrion. Once in a while they are able to hunt a human, but generally they prefer sewer rats since it is easier. Throughout the history, local folks are gathered and hunted those scavangers and protected their land. Still, scavanger vampires can be dangerous in groups and when they are so thirsty for human blood.

This is the first phase of the game which aims distributing unique vampires to players.
